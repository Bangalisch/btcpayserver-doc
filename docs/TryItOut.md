# Try out BTCPay server

We welcome you to Try out BTCPayserver as a Demo before you host it!
On this page we give you a quick introduction to the software, but also to partners and friends who provide environments and solutions.

## Try out BTCPayserver's own Demo environment

In this video we will show you a quick intro to using our own Demo environment.
Our Demo deployment is on Mainnet.
We do advise, although Mainnet is a live environment, to NOT use this as your real store!
