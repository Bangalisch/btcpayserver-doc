# Try out BTCPay server

We welcome you to Try out BTCPayserver as a Demo before you host it!
On this page we give you a quick introduction to the software, but also to partners and friends who provide environments and sollutions.

## Try out BTCPayserver's own Demo environment 

In this video we will show you a quick intro to using our own Demo environment. 
Our Demo deployment is on Mainnet. 
We do advise, although Mainnet is a live environment, to NOT use this as your real store!

I did add this to the Testnet page, which moved to Deployments.  ###
